            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>It all started back in 1938 during the Great Depression. In the midst
            of terrible times for the country, one young baker from Boston Massachusetts
            had a dream. Papa Snooky, as he came to be known, started baking cookies out
            of his Medford home, just to give his neighbors. He didn't ask for any money.
            He didn't even think of it as a business. All he wanted was to spread joy to
            those who seldom saw it, through his delicious cookies. To the lucky few in
            Papa's Medford neighborhood who ate his cookies, they were more than just
            delicious, they were a beam of light in dark times. A beam of light that they
            felt needed to be spread beyond Medford. And so, with the help of a community,
            the business was born. In 1939, Papa opened up the first ever Snooky's Cookies in Davis
            Square, in the neighboring town of Somerville. In the economic downturn, business was
            slow at first, but nothing would keep those cookies down. In 1941, after the depression
            ended Papa's son, Calvin, was able to open a second location in Boston's North End, which
            went on to become the most popular cookie bakery in the country. The rest, as they say,
            is history.
